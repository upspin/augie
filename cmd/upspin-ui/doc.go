Command upspin-ui presents a web interface to the Upspin name space,
and also provides a facility to sign up an Upspin user and deploy
an upspinserver to Google Cloud Platform.
It operates as the user in the specified config.
If no config is available at the specified path,
the user is prompted to sign up an Upspin user.

Browser features

The Upspin browser presents two navigation panes.

Each browser pane lists the contents of an Upspin directory.
The directory is shown in a text box at the top of each pane.

You can navigate directly to a specific Upspin path by typing (or pasting) it
into the text box and pressing the enter key.
The button to the left of the text box navigates to the parent of the current
directory.

Clicking the name of an entry will attempt to download the entry with your web
browser or, if the entry is a directory, will navigate to that directory.

At startup, the left pane displays the current user's root and the right pane
displays the path augie@upspin.io.

The checkboxes beside each entry permit the (de-)selection of entries.
The checkbox at the top of each list of entries (de-)selects all entries in
that directory.

The "Delete" button recursively deletes the selected files and directories.

The "Copy" button recurisively copies the selected files and directories to
the directory displayed in the opposite pane.

The "Make directory" button creates a directory in the pane's current
directory.

The "Refresh" button reloads the contents of the directory and displays it.

The info buttons (a little "i" in a circle, to the right of each file) display
extended information for a given directory entry.
